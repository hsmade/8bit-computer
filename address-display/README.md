# Address display
Shows both the address bus and data bus signals as HEX.

## Schema
![schema](../kicad/address%20display/address%20display.svg)

## Bugs / todo
* a NAND is used to invert the clock signal, which delays it a little, causing one of the display to ghost the other
* the PCB is horrible
