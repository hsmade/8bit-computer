Finished the CPU board.

I didn't add the irq LEDs yet. I'm not sure if I will.
After fixing some mistakes with the wiring, the board seems to work correctly.
However, the flatcable I created has issues. 
This is caused by the wires being a tiny bit too thin, and thus the cable doesn't properly fit the connectors.
I've ordered an old-school IDE cable online, to see if that works out better.

Because of the bad connections on the flatcable, the CPU doesn't get the proper data from the ROM, 
so it's just doing random stuff.

I also ordered better standoffs, as these are too small for the flatcable to fit.
So I needed to put two on top of each other.

After I get the stack of cpu + rom + bus display working correctly, 
I will start on the IO board.
I'm not 100% sure yet what I will use as peripherals. 
Most likely a 1602 Display to start with.
I was also thinking about interfacing with an i2c device, like a temperature sensor.
