I soldered the first 2 displays + control logic for the bus-display.
This should allow me to test it and fix errors before I put the rest on the board.
The displays seem to work, the eeprom seems to be connected correctly (I can produce the different outputs).
When I let it display `F0` for example, the segments in the `0` that are different from the `F`, are not fully lit.
When checking the 555 timer output, and the NAND inversion of that output,
I found that the 555 timer doesn't produce a square wave anymore. It did do that on the breadboard,
so I probably either broke something or made a mistake.
Of course I didn't solder an IC socket for the 555, as I didn't have any with 8 pins anymore...
To be investigated...
