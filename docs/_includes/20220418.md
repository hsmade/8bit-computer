Managed to get the bus display board working!

After some troubleshooting, I figured out that I overlooked something.
Both the `555` timer IC and the `74hc00` NAND IC, can not sink enough current for all the LED segments!
The timer even sinks less than the NAND, as it's more dim.
Since I supply power to the LEDs from the EEPROM data ports,
it ever occurred to me that all that current needs to actually go somewhere.
After going through my (limited) supply of parts, in my junk box, I found some `BD652` PNP power transistors.
I have no clue where I got these and when, but they seem to do the job just fine.
I soldered the rest of the segment displays, resistors and IC sockets,
and tested the board with all segments lit. It looks nice and bright (enough).
A bit of soldering later, the board was finished.
