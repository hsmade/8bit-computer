Lots of stuff happened since the last log, but I didn't really spend the time to keep track here.

### Flat cable adventures
I had a hard time getting the rainbow-colored flatcable to fit the connectors.
This caused all kind of issues with the communication between the boards.
In the end, I opted to use an old-school IDE cable.
This of course never turned up, so I bought one from a local computer store.
The cable I bought though, was a more modern IDE cable, with 80 wires and 40 pins.
This also has one pin not connected.

This cable did work a bit better, but still not to satisfaction.
I kept getting random bits flipped over.

### Pin headers
I then decided to use pin headers. These have sockets on top, and long legs on the bottom.
This means, I can stack the boards using the headers.

I desoldered the pin headers I had for the IDE cables, using solder flux.
Of course, I failed to properly clean the ROM board, before putting a new header on.
So when I connected everything together, it shorted out.

I decided to redo the ROM board.
This also gives me the opportunity to add a proper connector for connecting an Arduino Mega, 
for programming the EEPROM.

Here's the schematic for the new ROM board:

I'm just finished the control signals on the ROM board, and need to do the I/O.

### Bus display software bug
When you write software, you create bugs.
I found a bug in the bus display board. Instead of `CF`, it will display `FF`.
To fix this, however, I will need to finish my ROM board, annex programmer :)
