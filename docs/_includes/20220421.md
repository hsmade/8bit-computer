Doing a CPU board mock up.
I want the RAM on the same board as the CPU, or actually, I don't want to waste a whole board for the RAM.

I created a simple schema, so I could use the PCB layout to see what orientation would suite best.
I'm looking for the simples wiring, with few crossings. 
Which is kind of hard with every IC having a different layout for the address and data lines.

And I want to have 3 different clocks I can select from:
* 1 MHz
* external
* single step

For the single step, I should probably use something like a flip-flop, 
but just a debounced switch seems to do the trick with this CPU.

I also included a reset switch, and some lights for the interrupts:
* VP (Signals that we're inside an interrupt vector)
* IRQ
* NMI

This is what it ended up looking like. 
I'll let this sit for a bit and imagine the wiring process, see if it satisfies me.
