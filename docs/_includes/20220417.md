Refactored this whole repo, to give it more structure.

### Bus display board
After redoing some solder joints, the timer is outputting square waves again.
It does seem the `555` IC can't provide enough current for the led segments of 2 displays.
The `NAND` can, though. I soldered the rest of the segment displays and resistors to the board.
Next I will test if the NAND can provide enough current.
If so, I'll chain two gates together to power the right side displays, instead of the `555` timer.
